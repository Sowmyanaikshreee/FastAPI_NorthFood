    <p><h2>Karanji</h2>
    <p><b>“Karanji”</b> means fountain and true to our name, we embody the fountain of knowledge, skills, innovation and creativity.</p>
    <br><p>We are a one stop solution for any type of digital learning solutions. Our capabilities in various authoring tools, game development platforms, <b>AR, VR</b> and <b>MR</b> skills have enabled us to deliver engaging and innovative learning content to our customers. Digital learning is a creative field. Managing a digital learning project is completely a different art than managing a software development project. A digital content not only should work as per a <b>“set of requirements”,</b> it should also capture the interest and imagination of the target audience. This is what we have mastered over the past decade and a half.</p>
